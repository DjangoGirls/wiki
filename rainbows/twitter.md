# Social Media Guidelines 
Django Girls uses our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/djangogirls), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/djangogirls), and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/django_girls/) accounts, as well as our [blog](http://blog.djangogirls.org/), to promote our organization and our mission. Across all of these venues, we aim to promote positive images of women in technology, share the experiences of our workshops, and bring Django Girls to new cities all over the world. 

The Support Team, Awesomeness Ambassador, Django Story person, and anyone else listed [here](../general/people.md) in Social Media Team all have access to post to these accounts.  
## What to post
Our guidelines for what we post are pretty broad. 

- Blog posts from the Django Girls blog, and from other blogs about Django Girls events 
- Thank-you posts to sponors and to members of the community who help us out with things 
- Retweets/shares of organizers, coaches, and attendees who are excited about upcoming workshops, are currently at workshops, or who just got back from a great day at a workshop 
- Retweets/shares of people who do our tutorial at home and have good things to say 
- Retweets/shares of people who are generally encouraging us or one of our workshops
- Links to the monthly Support Team meeting agenda, or other "housekeeping" things 
- Links to other tutorials or videos that will help our users go beyond the workshop 
- Links to slide decks and videos of Django Girls presenting at conferences all over the world 
- Articles about women in tech
- CFPs for conferences (only if they have a Code of Conduct) 
- Requests for help (translators for a specific language, help with the Google Apps migration are two examples) 
- Thanks to Patreons, and requests for sponsorship! 
- DIY projects that could be put to use in workshops
- Cool things being done by other organizations who focus on getting more underrepresented people involved in tech or STEM. 

Basically, if whatever you're tweeting, retweeting, or posting is positive, would be interesting to Django Girls all over the world, and/or would be helpful to us, it's probably a good idea! 

# What not to post 

- Spam. We don't advertise for anyone. 
- Anything negative or hurtful. If you encounter someone online saying bad things about Django Girls, the best thing to do is not engage. The Django Girls social media pages do not engage in battles. 
  - If one of our users is having a problem, respond to them with the email address hello@djangogirls.org, and say we'd love to help them solve their problem. 
- Don't violate copyright. If you're posting an image or idea, be sure to give proper credit. 
- Promotion for conferences that don't have a Code of Conduct
