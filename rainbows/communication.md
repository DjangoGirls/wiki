# Communication Guidelines 
## Communication style
### Keep it short. SHORT!
Keep your email simple and short, but with a nice touch. We all get hundreds of emails every day, and rarely does anyone have time to read 3 paragraphs. 

- Every single word is important
- Plain english: keep it simple.
- Re-read, cut unnecessary words. Then re-read and cut more words. 
- Are you sure you need all those words? If you're not sure, ask someone to help you review it, so they can help you cut even more words! (Are you sensing a pattern?)
- Make space for some emojis! :sparkling_heart: :cherries: :balloon: :sparkles:
- Add one of our timeless signatures

### Always be nice
Tell people that they're awesome and that they rock. Because they do! 

Make sure your tone is always pleasant and welcoming. You might be the first person from Django Girls someone has ever spoken with, so make sure your email lets them know how fun, encouraging, and supportive we are! 
## Timeless signatures
Originally invented by Mikey Ariel and Baptiste Mispelon on 17th Febuary 2015 while discussing copyrights.

The first ever signature, by Mikey to Baptiste:

    Thanks! Hugs! Cupcakes!

Baptiste to Mikey:

    Cheers, high fives and donuts,

Since then, you see similar signatures in almost all Django Girls communication, including ones with sponsors! Feel free to be creative and a bit fun! Use the [Cute Email Signature Generator](https://cute-email-signatures.herokuapp.com/) when you need some inspiration! 
## What to do with hard emails?
Sometimes answering an e-mail is not trivial. If you receive an email where someone is rude, the problem is complex, or you're just not sure how to respond, discuss it with us on Slack. We'll help you draft something on Google Docs first, improve it, and then send it.
