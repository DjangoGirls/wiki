# Who we are

There are things we believe in that dictate how we do things. 

## Go the extra mile for people

This is by far the most important part. We try to do more than what's expected of us. We really wanna help people. We do this for the people, so we focus on what's best for them.

## Care about the details

We believe that the tiny little details of everything make a real difference. An emoji here an there, the flowers, the rainbows and the unicorns. Paying attention to details, to the subject of the email and the way we respond to things matters for us. 

## Quality is important

We don't produce bad products. We don't compromise on the quality of the t-shirts to make more money. We don't sell or give crappy things to people. We are always trying to produce the best possible work we can. 

## Give it your 100% 

It means no half-assing. Do it right, or not at all. If you don't know how to do it right, ask for help :)

## Design matters

Design influence the way people react to us and the things we do. So always make it pretty, easy to use and clean. If you are not sure that you can, ask for help :)
