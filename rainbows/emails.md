# Emails

Our main account is hello@djangogirls.org. See [Communication Guidelines](communication.md) for tips on how to keep emails short, strike an encouraging tone, and respond to difficult emails. 

## What happens when someone sends email to hello@djangogirls.org

1. First, the e-mail is automatically forwarded to each member of the support team. 
2. The e-mail is also automatically forwarded to django-girls-core mailing list, which serves as a read-only archive.
3. Whoever has free time first, replies to an e-mail.
4. :tada:

## CC! 

Can't stress this enough: **always add hello@djangogirls.org in cc for all your Django Girls communication**. This way we don't have to talk to each other a lot, and yet still everyone knows what's going on. 

This also allows us to pick up emails that haven't been responded to, so we know that conversation is not stuck on our end. 

If you want to discuss something inside of the support team, just e-mail hello@djangogirls.org, so you are sure to reach each member, and don't have to find individual email addresses.  

Always reply to all (unless you want to remove someone from conversation, or answer privately).

## support.team@djangogirls.org

> Introduced on 6th October, 2015

As the volume of emails on hello@djangogirls.org grew, and we hired Awesomeness Ambassador to handle most of the incoming communication, Support Team decided that there is no need for the whole team to read all of the hello@djangogirls.org emails. It also became clear that we need a way to bring something to the team's attention that is not going to disappear in the wave of other emails.

So since 6th of October 2015, we introduced a new, internal Google Group address support.team@djangogirls.org, that is meant to make it easy for Support Team to communicate effectively between each other.

- If Awesomness Ambassador, or any other Support Team member notice that there is a hello@djangogirls.org email that should be read by the whole team, they can forward it to support.team@djangogirls.org
- If Support Team member wants to communicate something important to other team members, they should send it to support.team@djangogirls.org

## Adding/removing someone from/to conversation

If you're adding someone new to CC or recipient of an email, or removing someone from the conversation, it's best to let others know that it happened. You can do this simply by doing something like this:

    [+Ola, Ania]
    Hey there!
    ...

or like this:

    [-hello@, +Ola]
    Hey there!
    ...

Handy!    

## Who should answer to emails?

Anyone can answer anything! It's good to divide somehow evenly, but it doesn't really matter that much. We aim to answer all emails in maximum three days. It's not always possible though.
