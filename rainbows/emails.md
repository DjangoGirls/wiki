# Emails

Our main account is hello@djangogirls.org.

## What happens when someone sends email to hello@djangogirls.org

1. First, the e-mail is automatically forwarded to each member of the support team. 
2. The e-mail is also automatically forwarded to django-girls-core mailing list, which serves as a read-only archive.
3. Whoever has free time first, replies to an e-mail.
4. :tada:

## CC! 

Can't stress this enough: **always add hello@djangogirls.org in cc for all your Django Girls communication**. This way we don't have to talk to each other a lot, and yet still everyone knows what's going on. 

This also allows us to pick up emails that haven't been responded to, so we know that conversation is not stuck on our end. 

If you want to discuss something inside of the support team, just e-mail hello@djangogirls.org, so you are sure to reach each member, and don't have to find individual email addresses.  

Always reply to all (unless you want to remove someone from conversation, or answer privately).

## Adding/removing someone from/to conversation

If you're adding someone new to CC or recipient of an email, or removing someone from the conversation, it's best to let others know that it happened. You can do this simply by doing something like this:

    [+Ola, Ania]
    Hey there!
    ...

or like this:

    [-hello@, +Ola]
    Hey there!
    ...

Handy!    

## Who should answer to emails?

Anyone can answer anything! It's good to divide somehow evenly, but it doesn't really matter that much. We aim to answer all emails in maximum three days. It's not always possible though.  

## What to do with hard emails?

Sometimes answering an e-mail is not trivial. If you're not sure what to write, discuss it with us on Slack. In this case we usually draft something up on Google Drive first, improve it, and then send it. 

## Communication style

### Keep it short. SHORT!

Keep your email simple and short, but with a nice touch. We all get hundreds of emails every day, and rarely does anyone have time to read 3 paragraphs. Ola Sitarska has an allergy for long e-mails.

- Every single word is important
- Plain english: keep it simple.
- Re-read, cut unnecessary words
- Then read it again and cut more words
- Do you really need all these words?
- Then ask someone to review it, so they can cut even more words (Are you sensing a pattern?)
- Maybe one more word? Make space for some emojis!
- Add one of our timeless signatures
- Maybe some :sparkles:?

### Be nice

Tell people that they're awesome and that they rock. Because they do! 

## Timeless signatures

Originally invented by Mikey Ariel and Baptiste Mispelon on 17th Febuary 2015 while discussing copyrights.

The first ever signature, by Mikey to Baptiste:

    Thanks! Hugs! Cupcakes!

Baptiste to Mikey:

    Cheers, high fives and donuts,

Since then, you see similar signatures in almost all Django Girls communication, including ones with sponsors! Feel free to be creative and a bit fun!
