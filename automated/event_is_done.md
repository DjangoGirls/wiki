# What happen when a workshop is over?

If the event was not on the event list, it will be archived and nothing else will happen. If the event happened:

- Organizers will receive a thank you email and an invitation to fill applicants and attendees stats.
- They won't be able to edit their website anymore. If they want to do another event, they need to fill the [application form](https://djangogirls.org/organize/) again. If they want to edit their sponsors, coaches section, etc: you'll need to do it for them.
