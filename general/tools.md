# Tools

We use various tools to help us stay on track and do things for us. We believe that tools are awesome and there is absolutely no reason to write a single line of code if someone else can do this for us. Here is a list of tools we use, and what do we use it for.

## Google Apps

We're using a non-profit version of Google Apps (free, forever). We use it for creating accounts for each event (city@djangogirls.org), and aliases (city@djangogirls.com -> city@djangogirls.org).

Login details are in 1Password.

## Trello

We use [Trello](http://trello.com/) for managing tasks and assignments. Our main Trello board is the one public for everyone: [Django Girls Trello](https://trello.com/b/q7p6jcfg/django-girls). We use it for almost all tasks. 

Make sure to always assign yourself to thing you've committed yourself to do, and move the card to "in progress" or "done" to let others know that things are happening. 

There are also two private Trello boards:
- [Django Girls Foundation](https://trello.com/b/BEIUCkCZ/django-girls-foundation) -- for all tasks and documents regarding the foundation. We're not sure if we can make this public, it's also just boring bureaucracy. Probably better to keep it private until we figure this out. 
- [Django Girls [PRIVATE]](https://trello.com/b/MhTXkuii/django-girls-private) -- if you wonder if adding task to a publicly could hurt or put at risk Django Girls, Django Girls Foundation, or any person involved in Django Girls, it's better to discuss it with the team or put it on a private board. 

## Slack

[Slack](http://slack.com/) is our real time communication channel, and you can read more about how we use it in the [Start Sparkling Guide](sparkling.md).

Slack is also used by all of our organizers, supporters and friends of Django Girls. There is no general rule who can be there, but we want to keep it safe for everyone to express their ideas, so be mindful about that. Only the Support Team has the permission to invite others to Slack.

## GitHub

[GitHub](http://github.com/) is our main documentation / code sharing tool. All of our repos are public and you can find them [here](https://github.com/DjangoGirls).

## Google Drive

We use one shared Django Girls folder to manage our files. Basically, every single file we create should end up there, in a proper folder. If you put it in the folder, it's gonna be automatically shared with the whole team. 

Make sure to notify us that you put a new file there if you want us to know about this, because Google Drive doesn't send a notification about this.

## Mailing lists

We use various mailing lists (on Google Groups) to make it easier for us to communicate in a big group. [Read more about mailing lists here](mailing-lists.md).

## Gitbook

[Gitbook](http://gitbook.io/) is a tool we use to publish [Tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/), [Organizer's Manual](http://organize.djangogirls.org), [Coaching Guide](http://coach.djangogirls.org), [Tutorial Extensions](https://www.gitbook.com/book/djangogirls/django-girls-tutorial-extensions/details) and [Translation Guidelines](http://translate.djangogirls.org).

The Gitbook books are linked to Github via webhooks, so whenever something is commited to master, the book will rebuild itself automatically. At Gitbook you can go in "Activity" tab to see all builds of the book.

It's also handy to install Gitbook locally if you want to test some bigger PR to the tutorial before uploading it to Gitbook.

## Crowdin

[Crowdin](http://crowdin.com/) is our tutorial translation tool. To be honest, we haven't quite figured it out yet. 

## 1Password for Teams

[1Password for Teams](http://1password.com/) is where we keep all of our passwords for services that doesn't support adding members to accounts. 

**You should keep your 1Password really safe!**

## Tumblr

[Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) is what we use as our blogging platform. 

## PythonAnywhere

[PythonAnywhere](http://pythonanywhere.com/) hosts our djangogirls.org website.

## MailChimp

[Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com/) is a tool we use for newsletters and marketing campaigns. We've got a template that we always use there.

## CloudFlare

[CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com/) is our DNS, and they also give us SSL for free :)
 
## Pycharm
 
 We have a few Open Sources licenses to use [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for free. If you're on the Support Team and need one to work on Django Girls related projects, contact the [Ambassador](mailto:lucie@djangogirls.org) ;)
