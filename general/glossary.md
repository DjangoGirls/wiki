# Glossary

There are the terms we use inside the team that can confuse you at first.

### Gummy bear kind of people

Ola Sitarska was looking for a t-shirt provider, and she ordered a sample t-shirt. When the package arrived, it turned out that there is a t-shirt and pack of gummy bears inside. We call people who go beyond & above to satisfy you "the gummy bear kind of people".

### Beetroot (or burak)

In Polish there is a funny name for internet (or non-internet) trolls: burak. We simply call them beetroots. We find this funny that people find it confusing.

### Pierogi

We love pierogi. 

### Mustasz / moustache

Ania loves moustaches.

### `❄️🍆` (snowflake eggplant)

The emoji translation of "cool beans" (it was decided that the eggplant is the closest emoji we have to a bean).

### `⚡⚡⚡` (zapzapzap)

When someone is doing a lot of work at once (like answering a dozen pending email within a couple of minutes).
