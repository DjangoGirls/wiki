# Mailing lists 

We've got a couple of mailing lists at Google Groups.

## django-girls

This is the main public mailing list, available for everyone who wants to be a part of it. We post announcements here. Everyone can discuss whatever they want to discuss.

## django-girls-spanish

This group is public. It has the same objectives as the django-girls mailing list but in Spanish.

## django-girls-organizers

This is a private mailing lists for organizers only. We use this to announce things that concerns organizers only, look for volunteers, discuss things with them.
 
 To be sure to reach everyone, you can add organizers@djangogirls.org in CC.

## django-girls-core

This is a private mailing list, but we use it only as a read-only archive of hello@djangogirls.org. Every e-mail that goes to hello@djangogirls.org, also goes to this mailing list. When we onboard a new member of the team, they can go there to read or search through archive to see how we handled things in the past. 

## django-girls-poland

This is a private group for Polish organizers only. We use it to communicate with each other, borrow things, discuss matters that concern only Polish organizers.

## dg-translations-private

This is a group for the Support Team and Translation Managers (Rebecca and Tomas). There is an email translations@djangogirls.org. If someone sends anything to it, it's forwarded and posted to this mailing list, where we all are members, so we get this email too. In general, if you want to communicate with this team, just cc or send to translations@.
