# Add person to Tweetdeck

Many people are helping us with our Twitter account. Recently we decided to finaly move to using 
[Tweetdeck](tweetdeck.twitter.com) for this purpose. It allows us to allow people to Tweet without sharing 
password with many people and in case we change it, we don't really need to inform any of them.

## How to add someone as Contributor?

1. Go to [Tweetdeck](tweetdeck.twitter.com)
2. Log in with your own Twitter credentials (all support team members have admin rights). You could also use @djangogirls account credentials that are stored in Meldium.
3. Click icon with "Accounts" (icon with users) - you will find it on left hand side at the bottom.
4. Choose Django Girls and then "Team @djangogirls"
5. Add Twitter handle of person you want to add and click "Authorize".

That's it!
