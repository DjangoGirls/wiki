# Copy an event

These are instructions on what to do when organizers from some city want to organize a second (or third, or fourth) edition.

## Instructions

1. Instruct organizers to fill out the "Organizing Application Form" again.
2. Use the Application triaging system to accept their application.

### What will happen automatically?

1. The new `Event` object will be created, which will be a copy of the previous
event in that city, but with a new date.

2. Team will be updated according to information provided in application.

3. New team members will be invited to Slack and Django Girls Admin. The credentials
to login to the website will be sent to them automatically.

4. Event's Django Girls e-mail account will be updated if required.

 - If there is at least one member of the event that was in the previous team, nothing
 will be changed in the e-mail account. Organizer should share the password
 with the rest of the team members

 - If all team members are new, old e-mail account will be changed to CityMonthYear@djangogirls.org
 and fresh new city@djangogirls.org account will be created.

5. All team members will receive e-mail with Event Setup information.
