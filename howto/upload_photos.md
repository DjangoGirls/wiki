# Django Girls Flickr account

The [Django Girls flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/) is where organisers can upload pictures of their workshop. New albums will automatically be shared on the Django Girls Facebook and Twitter accounts.

The email template is [available here](../howto/emails/flickr_email.md).

We currently receive a free premium account due to our Not for Profit status, however, this expires every 2 years. To renew the premium account (required to host our photos as we have too many for a free account) then contact help@flickr.com and they will arrange this for you.
