# Django Girls workshop box

The [workshop box](https://djangogirls.org/workshop-box/) is a small parcel full of stickers, buttons, and balloons to help make Django Girls workshop more fun. Organizers can buy it on the [store](https://store.djangogirls.org/products/django-girls-workshop-box) or get one for free **only if they met certain requirements**.

Email templates are [available here](../howto/emails/workshop_box.md).

## Free box requirements:

- Their event must happen in a developing country or they tried but can't find any sponsor.
- They need to have a venue for their workshop.
- Their application process for their event needs to be open
- They need to order it at least 6 weeks before the workshop to allow for shipping time. Check this because they tend to be late!

## What to do if an organizer complains about not receiving the box

Organizers will contact you from time to time because they didn't receive their box. Here's what to do:

1. Ask the organizer for the tracking number. You can also find this info in the [store admin](https://django-girls.myshopify.com/admin).
2. While you're in the store admin, check if something went wrong there. If everything is okay, move to the next steps!
3. Check if the package left Poland using the [polish post's website](http://emonitoring.poczta-polska.pl/?lang=en)
4. When the package is out of Poland, you need to track it using the local post website. Find the one you're looking for [on that page](http://www.poczta-polska.pl/paczki-i-listy/przesylki-zagraniczne/listy/sledzenie-przesylek-zagranicznych-listy/).

Two situations can happen now:

1. You have information on where is the package: most of the time, the package is at the post office, waiting to be collected. Send that info to the organizer with a link to the local tracking website.
2. You have zero info because the local tracking website can't find the package or is completely broken (true story!). This will especially happen with packages sent to the US: they can't track your package because $REASONS. You need to report this to the organizer: you try to find info but you have nothing so they need to go or call their local post office. Don't blame yourself: there's nothing more you can do! If the package is completely lost, it may come back to Poland or start a new exciting life somewhere else. Either way, if the organizer paid for the box, reimburse them through the store admin.
