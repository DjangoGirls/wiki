Dear **[Event organizer name]**,

We’re really sad to let you know that Django Girls Support Team made a decision to remove Django Girls **[City]** event from our homepage and revoke your right to use Django Girls name.

We appreciate your willingness to help spread Django Girls in your community, however, we’re having following issues with our collaboration:

-
-
-

We may reconsider the decision and allow this event to continue only if issues outlined before are explained by you. We will also require you to find another co-organizer for the **[City]** event.

We’re happy to hear your side of the story. If there is anything we can do to help **[City]** event happen, please let us know.

Thanks!
Django Girls Support Team
