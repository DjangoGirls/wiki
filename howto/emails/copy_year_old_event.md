# E-mail template: Email for a one year old team making a new event

Hi there!

Congratulations on running a new Django Girls event! You rock!

New features were added to the website since your last event: you can now manage applications from potential attendees on your website! To learn more about this, check our [organizer manual](http://organize.djangogirls.org/) ;)

1) Email

Your e-mail is **[Add email]**
Login here: http://mail.djangogirls.org/
**[Add email]** (@djangogirls.com works too!)
**[Add password]**
You can also add this inbox to your email client:
- IMAP: imap.gmail.com (SSL, port 993)
- SMTP: smtp.gmail.com (SSL, port 465)

Or you can forward incoming mail to your private email account by following these instructions: http://gappstips.com/gmail/automatically-forward-emails-to-multiple-recipients-in-gmail/

2) Website

Your website address is still http://djangogirls.org/**[nameofthecity]**

Login here:
http://djangogirls.org/admin/
**[New accounts]** or "Same credentials as before ;)"

Your website is currently hidden for public, you can only see it if you’re logged in. If you want to make it available for everyone, go here: http://djangogirls.org/admin/core/eventpage/ and edit your website changing “is live” option.

Instructions on editing website: http://organize.djangogirls.org/website/

Let me know if you need anything. It’s usually faster to post questions to our Google Group of Django Girls Organizers or Slack channel - there are more people that can help you! :)

Hugs, rainbows and sunshines!
