# Email template: Setup email for new team in a city that already had an event.

Hi there!

Congrats! I just created your Django Girls chapter website & email.

1) Email

Your e-mail is [EVENT EMAIL]

Login here: http://mail.djangogirls.org/
[CITY]@djangogirls.org (@djangogirls.com works too!)
====PASSWORD====

You can also add this inbox to your email client:

Or you can forward incoming mail to your private email account by following these instructions: http://gappstips.com/gmail/automatically-forward-emails-to-multiple-recipients-in-gmail/

2) Website

Your website address is [EVENT WEBSITE]

Login here:
http://djangogirls.org/admin/
====CREDENTIALS====

Your website is currently hidden for public, you can only see it if you’re logged in. If you want to make it available for everyone, go here: http://djangogirls.org/admin/core/eventpage/ and edit your website changing “is live” option.

Instructions on editing website: http://organize.djangogirls.org/website/

3) Postponing or canceling

If you need to cancel or postpone your event, please, send us an email. It can happen and we won't be mad at you ;) Also, if you're stuck on something, we can try to help you!

4) Workshop box

To help you reduce the cost of your event, we created a workshop box full of Django Girls stickers, nametags, badges and golden letter balloons. When your website is ready and your registration open, you can order one here. To be sure it arrives on time, you'll need to order it at least 6 weeks before your event ;)

You can contact me again if you need assistance but it’s usually faster to check our FAQ(http://organize.djangogirls.org/faq/index.html) or to post questions to our Google Group of Django Girls Organizers(https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-girls-organizers) or Slack channel(https://djangogirls.slack.com) - there are more people that can help you! :)

Hugs, rainbows and sunshines!
