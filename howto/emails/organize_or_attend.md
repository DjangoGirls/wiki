# E-mail template: Email to send when you're not sure if people want to attend or organize an event

Hi [NAME],

Thanks for your email!

I'm not sure if you want to organize a workshop or just attend one.

If you want to know more about organizing a workshop, you can check [Django Girls Organizer Manual](http://organize.djangogirls.org/) and our [blog](http://blog.djangogirls.org/), where previous organizers share their experience ;)

If you want to attend a workshop: check on our [event page](https://djangogirls.org/events/) to see if an event is planned in your city. If not, don't hesitate to meet meet with friends to do the tutorial and get help in our [chat room](https://gitter.im/DjangoGirls/tutorial).

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
