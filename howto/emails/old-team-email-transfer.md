# Email template: Previous team: updating email account and website URL

Hi team,

Just a really quick email to tell you we need to make some changes to your Django Girls event. A new team want to organize an event in Kochi so we need to update your event email account and website address.

Your new email is now: [CityMonthYear]@djangogirls.org
You can access it with your previous credentials and it contains all your emails.
You won't be able to access [City]@djangogirls.org anymore, which also mean that the new team won't have access to all your previous emails.
Your event website URL is now: djangogirls.org/[CityNumber]

If you have any social account connected to the event (twitter, facebook, etc), can you give me their password and username? If you used [City]@djangogirls.org account to register, just tell me and I will ask the new organizers to use the "reset" function.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any question ;)

Have a nice day!
Cupcakes and high fives,
