Hi [NAME],

Thanks for your email!

We reviewed your application but we think that you need more time working on your project before we can give you a positive answer.
You can read [Django Girls Organizer Manual](http://organize.djangogirls.org/) and check our [blog](http://blog.djangogirls.org/) to see what organizing an event looks like and the amount of work it will require.

When you have more things planned (potential date, venue, sponsors, etc), fill this form again and we will get back to you ;)

Have a nice day!
