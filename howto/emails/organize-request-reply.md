# E-mail template: First reply for new organizer request

Hi **[Name]**,

We would love to have you as an organizer of Django Girls in **[Insert City]**!

There are two requirements to become an organizer of Django Girls:
- being an awesome person - done! :) 
- reading our Organizer's Manual: http://organize.djangogirls.org/

Event needs to be free for participants and women have a preference in the application process (but men can apply, too). You should also use our [tutorial we prepared for a workshop](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/), and work in small groups of attendees and coaches. Other than that, you have a complete freedom to do an amazing event however you want it :) 

Once you confirm that you've read the Organizer's Manual (so you know what you're getting yourself into!), I'll get you started with access to our private community groups, website, etc.

You're super cool!

Have a nice day :)  
Hugs, rainbows and sunshines!
