# E-mail template: First reply for new organizer request

Hi **[Name]**,

We would love to have you as an organizer of Django Girls in **[Insert City]**!

There are three requirements for becoming an organizer of Django Girls:
- being an awesome person - done! :) 

- The event should be free for participants, and women should have a preference in the application process (but men can apply, too). You should also use the [tutorial we've prepared for workshops](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/), and work in small groups of attendees and coaches (each group working at their own pace).

- Share our values: Django Girls events are inclusive, friendly and provide safe environments that follow an enforced [Code of Conduct](https://djangogirls.org/pages/coc/). Remember that Django Girls events are not only aimed to teach people about programming, but to do it in a friendly and positive way.

Before we can give you an answer, please read our [Organizer's Manual](http://organize.djangogirls.org/) (so you know what you're getting yourself into!). Once you're done, send us an email ;)

You're super cool!

Have a nice day :)
Hugs, rainbows and sunshines!
