# E-mail template: Thank you email for organizers

Hi **[Name]**,

Congratulations on running your own Django Girls event!

We're super proud and happy for you :)

Whenever you have time, do you mind sharing what you've learned with us? Below is a couple of questions, but feel free to share whatever you find interesting :)

1) Number of attendees
2) Number of applicants
3) What was the most important thing you discovered during the workshop?
4) How can we make Django Girls better?
5) Were you able to cover the cost of the event by finding sponsors?
6) Anything else you want to share with us?

Especially, we would like to have the answers to 1 and 2 questions as soon as possible so we can update the counters in footer on our website :)

If you want to write on your experience as an organizer or share with the community all the awesome things that happened during your event, you can write a post on our [blog](http://blog.djangogirls.org/submit). You did something cool: don't be shy and brag about it!

If you would like to add your pictures to our Flickr account (https://www.flickr.com/photos/djangogirls/), just tell us and we will give more details about that.

It'd be also great if you could invite all of your attendees and coaches to join our Django Girls mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-girls) so they can stay in touch with the community. If you don't have permissions to invite them yet, let us know, we will grant them to you. After that, is as simple as pasting email addresses and writing a short invitation. Of course, they won't be added automatically, they will still have to accept the invitation.

Since we now have our own shop, we can generate discount codes! Use [CODE] to get a 15% discount on your order. You can share this code with your coaches and attendees ;) All proceeds will go to Django Girls Foundation to make the charity sustainable.

If you want to plan an other event someday, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://djangogirls.org/organize/) again!

Thanks and congrats yet again, you're awesome!
Hugs, rainbows and sunshines!
