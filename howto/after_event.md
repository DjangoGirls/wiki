# Congratulations the organizers!

After each event, our website will automatically send organizers an e-mail
thanking them for the organization and requesting them to add statistics about
the attendance of their event.

If organizers won't update the numbers within a week, they will receive another
automatic email with a reminder to do it.

If they still don't do it, Support Team or Awesomeness Ambassador can do it for them
by copy pasting the information from the applications system. Below you can read how to do it.
