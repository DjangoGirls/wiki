# How to update the Newsletter page on Django Girls Website

We publish our Newsletters using Mailchimp. [Mailchimp provides integration code](https://mailchimp.com/help/add-an-email-campaign-archive-to-your-website/) 
for us which is already contained in the Newsletter HTML template in our templates folder. You do not need to make any changes to this page to make 
new newsletters appear on the website. To add the newsletter(s) to our Past Editions on the Newsletter page, you need to do the following:

1. Login to our Mailchimp account.
2. Click on the ```Campaign Icon```. This will list all the campaigns we have done.
3. Select the campaigns you want to add to the website by clicking the select box on the left of each newsletter.
4. Click on the ```Move To``` and choose the ```Previous Newsletters```folder. This will move them to the ```Previous Newsletters``` which is already 
integrated to our website.
5. You are all done and can log out of Mailchimp.

For more detailed instructions, you can read [Mailchimp documentation](https://mailchimp.com/help/organize-campaigns-into-folders/) on this.
