# Deploy a new city (Archival)

> This is a previous way of deploying the new city before we introduced automated event applications. We leave it for a reference, as it explains quite nicely what steps are needed to deploy the city.

**1) Create a website:**

Login to PythonAnywhere and go into bash. Type following commands:

```
$ workon djangogirls.com
$ cd djangogirls.com
$ python manage.py new_event
```

And then follow the instructions and answer the questions as you're prompted.

Note: You can also use `./manage.py new_event -s` to get a shorter version with basic info about the event (recipients, subject, event email and URL).

**2) Add to django-girls-organizers mailing list:**

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/django-girls-organizers/add

Example welcome message:
> This is a private group for Django Girls organizers only. We plan to use it to exchange ideas, help each other and share knowledge :smile: Please, use this list for all your questions or concerns.

**3) Create e-mail address:**

1. Go to [Google Apps Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/AdminHome#UserList:org=1glcp172anflfd)
2. Click on "Users"
3. Click on "Add User" button in the right bottom corner.
  - First name: Django Girls
  - Last name: [Name of the city]
  - Primary email address: [nameofthecity]@djangogirls.org
  - Click "Additional info":
    - Secondary email address: [private, non @djangogirls email of main organizer]
  - Click "Create"
4. Copy password.

**5) Send e-mail instructions:**

Organizers will receive a different email with their admin credentials. You'll need to send them a copy of the email generated by the `new_event` script. Don't forget to replace the e-mail password :smile:

:tada:!

## What is happening in the background:

The current event deployement method use the [`new_event` management command](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/djangogirls/blob/master/core/management/commands/new_event.py). Events created that way receive a [template website to customize](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/djangogirls/blob/master/core/default_eventpage_content.py), are automatically added to the [event page list](https://djangogirls.org/events/) with a [random picture](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/djangogirls/tree/master/pictures). All the info you gave the `new_event` script are available at the [`event's detail page`](https://djangogirls.org/admin/core/event/) in the admin interface.

Organizers are added to their event and [automatically receive an email](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/djangogirls/blob/master/core/emails.py) with their admin password.

Events are also added to the [events Trello board](https://trello.com/b/nWNEA8bf/events-calendar): you can use this board to get a bigger picture of our next events.

## Uh oh, I made a mistake while deploying an event!

Don't worry, that happens! You can fix it on the [event details page](https://djangogirls.org/admin/core/event/).
