# Deploy a new city

> This is a description of a proccess to setup a new Django Girls city chapter.

**1) Create a website:**

Login to PythonAnywhere and go into bash. Type following commands:

```
$ workon djangogirls.com
$ cd djangogirls.com
$ python manage.py new_event
```

And then follow the instructions and answer the questions as you're prompted.

**2) Add to django-girls-organizers mailing list:**

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/django-girls-organizers/add

Example welcome message:
> This is a private group for Django Girls organizers only. We plan to use it to exchange ideas, help each other and share knowledge :smile: Please, use this list for all your questions or concerns.

We no longer need to send e-mail with instructions - our `new_event` command is doing it for us. Yay!

:tada:!
