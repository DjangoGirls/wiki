# Someone applied to organize Django Girls event...

..and now what?

## The ideal process

1. A person goes to [Organize page](https://djangogirls.org/organize/) and fills out the form.
2. The person provides enough details for us to realize that they:
 - have read the Organizer's Manual
 - they're pretty cool people.
3. We accept their application in the admin and magic happens.
4. :tada:

## Troubleshooting

#### You can't figure if they want to organize or attend an event

Send them the [organize or attend template e-mail](emails/organize_or_attend.md).

#### You can't really judge if the person meets the conditions from point 2

Move their application to "in review" and ask additional questions by replying to
the email with their application.

If they seem not ready, move their application to "rejected" state. Hopefully, they will check the Organizer Manual and contact us when they're more prepared.

#### Still not sure if this person should organize Django Girls event?

- Hangout with them on Google Hangouts.
- Find someone in the community to vouch for them.
- Talk to them more via emails.
- Recommend finding a co-organizer first.

#### Organizer changed their mind or stopped replying?

Move their application into "in hold" state and add a comment. If they haven't replied for a longer period (like 30 days) reject their application.
