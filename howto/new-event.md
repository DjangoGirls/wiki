# Someone applied to organize Django Girls event...

..and now what? 

## The ideal proccess

1. A person goes to [Organize page](https://djangogirls.org/organize/) and fills out the form.
2. The person provides enough details for us to realize that they:
 - have read the Organizer's Manual
 - they're pretty cool people.
3. We follow the [Deploy to city process](deploy-city.md).
4. :tada:

## Troubleshooting

#### We can't really judge if the person meets the conditions from point 2

Send them the [first reply for new organizer request e-mail](emails/organize-request-reply.md). Hopefully this is gonna shed some more light on the person.

#### Still not sure if this person should organize Django Girls event?

- Hangout with them on Google Hangouts. 
- Find someone in the community to vouch for them.
- Talk to them more via emails.
- Recommend finding a co-organizer first.
