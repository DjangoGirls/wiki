# Someone applied to organize Django Girls event...

..and now what? 

## The ideal process

1. A person goes to [Organize page](https://djangogirls.org/organize/) and fills out the form.
2. The person provides enough details for us to realize that they:
 - have read the Organizer's Manual
 - they're pretty cool people.
3. We follow the [Deploy to city process](deploy-city.md).
4. :tada:

## Troubleshooting

#### You can't figure if they want to organize or attend an event

Send them the [organize or attend template e-mail](emails/organize_or_attend.md).

#### You can't really judge if the person meets the conditions from point 2

If they seem not ready, send them the [not enough pre-planning e-mail template](emails/not_enough_pre-planning.md). Hopefully, they will check the Organizer Manual and contact us when they're more prepared.

#### They already have a good idea on how they want to organize their workshop and have read the Organizer Manual

Send them the [first reply for new organizer request e-mail](emails/organize-request-reply.md).

#### Still not sure if this person should organize Django Girls event?

- Hangout with them on Google Hangouts. 
- Find someone in the community to vouch for them.
- Talk to them more via emails.
- Recommend finding a co-organizer first.
