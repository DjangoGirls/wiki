# Sample "Django Story" HTML 
There are a couple of tricky parts about posting the Django Story in terms of the HTML. We've included some sample HTML that we hope will be helpful! 

## Introduction 
The first paragraph should stay the same; the second paragraph is where you can introduce your interviewee based on the 2-3 sentence biography they sent you. 
```
<p>This is a post in our <a href="http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/96968775978/your-django-story">Your Django Story</a> series where we highlight awesome ladies who work with Django. <a href="http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/96968775978/your-django-story">Read more about it here.</a></p>

<p>Sonia is a Latina developer into yoga, coding, social media marketing, and running. She's also an animated and tea + wine aficionado.</p>

## Questions 
```
<h3>How did your story with code start?</h3>
<p>I learned Basic and Cobol on a Macintosh in the 5th grade. I spent time at the library to utilize computers outside of the classroom. Which also evolved into a love of reading.</p>

Includes a thank-you to the interviewee, information about how to suggest someone as an interviewee, as well as information about you as the interviewer! 
``` 
Thanks Sonia! :) If you would like to suggest someone to be featured in the Your Django Story series (or would like to nominate yourself!), send an email to story@djangogirls.org!
