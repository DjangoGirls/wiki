# How to write fortnight Django Girls Dispatch

Every two weeks we send Django Girls Dispatch. For now we divided work into all people in the support team, since we could not find anyone interested to do that. We hope that in some time we will find a volunteer to continue the work.

## How?

We use [Createsend](https://djangogirls.createsend.com/) to create our newsletters.

1. Go to [https://djangogirls.createsend.com/](https://djangogirls.createsend.com/).
2. Use credentails from Meldium (under "Campaign Monitor") to log in.
3. Click "Create a new campaign" button (big green button on the right).
4. Choose name and so on and after accepting choose one of the previous newsletters as a base.
5. Start to write!
