# Update source text of tutorial on Crowdin

1. Have crowdin tool installed: https://crowdin.com/page/cli-tool
2. Pull tutorial from master to get the newest version on your machine
3. If you're doing that for the first time, edit `crowdin.yaml` file and change `base_path` to match path on your machine.
4. Run `crowdin-cli upload sources`

That's it! :tada:
