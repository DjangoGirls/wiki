# How to manage GitHub sponsorship

Since July 2016, GitHub only sponsor one event per city. Only events happening in countries where it's difficult to find sponsors can apply for another sponsorship.

Events that already received sponsorship from GitHub are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kzg1pe0FLOBcIGAZEt-RNhJzAU4AhBq0Ndv3jlP768E/edit#gid=0).

## What organizers need to do:

They need to fill the form available on [this page](https://djangogirls.org/sponsor-request/). Form results are sent by email to hello@djangogirls.org.

## What the Support Team needs to do:

* Collect organizers invoices. Check if they've filled the good forms (US: ACH request and the W9 form, elsewhere: wire request) and didn't forget the invoice. Check that those form are correctly filled (especially the invoice!).
* Every two weeks, send an [email](../howto/emails/GitHub_sponsorship.md) to our contact at GitHub with the new invoices and forms. Next shipping dates are marked on [Django Girls Support Team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).
* Our current GitHub contact is Brian Douglas - developer@github.com
* Send an [email](../howto/emails/GitHub_sponsorship.md) to organizers who applied for a sponsorship.
* Update [the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kzg1pe0FLOBcIGAZEt-RNhJzAU4AhBq0Ndv3jlP768E/edit#gid=0) of events that received GitHub sponsorship.
