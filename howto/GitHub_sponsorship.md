# How to manage GitHub sponsorship

Since July 2016, GitHub only sponsor one event per city. Only events happening in countries where it's difficult to find sponsors can apply for another sponsorship.

Events that already received sponsorship from GitHub are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kzg1pe0FLOBcIGAZEt-RNhJzAU4AhBq0Ndv3jlP768E/edit#gid=0).

## What organizers need to do:

At least one month before their event, they need to fill one or two [forms](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxqF-fMgUfHUM0lRSGhBVjNyT1U) and send them to us. Full process is described in the [Organizer Manual](http://organize.djangogirls.org/sponsors/#github-sponsorship).

## What the Support Team needs to do:   

* Collect organizers invoices. Check if they've filled the good forms (US: ACH request and the W9 form, elsewhere: wire request).
* Add those forms [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxqF-fMgUfHUSkIzRS1xdVRuTUE).
* Every two weeks, send an [email](../howto/emails/GitHub_sponsorship.md) to our contact at GitHub with the new invoices. Next shipping dates are marked on Django Girls Support Team calendar.
* Send an [email](../howto/emails/GitHub_sponsorship.md) to organizers who applied for a sponsorship.
* Update [the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kzg1pe0FLOBcIGAZEt-RNhJzAU4AhBq0Ndv3jlP768E/edit#gid=0) of events that received GitHub sponsorship.
