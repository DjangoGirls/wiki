# How to write fortnight Django Girls Dispatch

Every two weeks we send Django Girls Dispatch. For now, we've divided work across all members of the support team. We hope that in time we will find a volunteer to continue the work.

## How?

We use [Mailchi](https://login.mailchimp.com/) to create our newsletters.

1. Go to [https://login.mailchimp.com/](https://login.mailchimp.com/).
2. Use credentails from Meldium (under "Mailchimp") to log in.
3. Click on `Regular Campaign` in `Create Campaign` drop-down menu.
4. Chose `Django Girls Newsletter` and click on next (hidden at the bottom right of the page).
5. Fill the `Name your campaign` and `Email subject` fields.
6. Click on `Auto-tweet campaign as djangogirls` and `Auto-post to Facebook after sending` and fill those fields.
7. Click on next.
8. Select `Classic newsletter template` in `Saved Templates` tab.
9. Write the Dispacth! If you need help, Mailchimp has awesome docs: you can access it by clicking on help or by going [here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/).
10. When you're done, send a test email: click on `Preview and Test` and `Send a test email`.
11. When you're happy and ready to send the Dispatch, click on next and do the final checklist.
12. Click on `send`
13. Do a victory dance, you've earned it!
14. Go back to the Dashboard and click on `Campaigns` in the top menu.
15. Select the campaign you've just sent and move it to `Previous Newsletter`: it will update our [newsletter page](https://djangogirls.org/newsletter/) on Django Girls website.

## Where to look for resources?

* check tweets about Django Girls in last 2 weeks
* check new [Django Stories](https://djangogirls.org/story/) that appeared since last newsletter. Make sure to check our blog first, since website could have not the most recent stories linked.
* check our [blog](http://blog.djangogirls.org/) for other news, too.
* check events from last 2 weeks - have any of the organizers written something about their events? Any new photo albums, etc.?
* has anyone mentioned Django Girls in any article? Maybe we can add that to the newsletter, too!
* if we are planning or in the process of some important things (like hiring, working on some bigger project, starting some campaign) - make sure to mention it. 
* check [GitHub](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/tutorial) - any big changes in last fortnight? Any new translations finished?
* add upcoming events.
