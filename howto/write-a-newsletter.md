# How to write fortnight Django Girls Dispatch

Every two weeks we send Django Girls Dispatch. For now, we've divided work across all members of the support team. We hope that in time we will find a volunteer to continue the work.

## How?

We use [Createsend](https://djangogirls.createsend.com/) to create our newsletters.

1. Go to [https://djangogirls.createsend.com/](https://djangogirls.createsend.com/).
2. Use credentails from Meldium (under "Campaign Monitor") to log in.
3. Click "Create a new campaign" button (big green button on the right).
4. Choose name and so on and after accepting, choose one of the previous newsletters as a base.
5. Start to write!

## Where to look for resources?

* check tweets about Django Girls in last 2 weeks
* check new [Django Stories](https://djangogirls.org/story/) that appeared since last newsletter. Make sure to check our blog first, since website could have not the most recent stories linked.
* check our [blog](http://blog.djangogirls.org/) for other news, too.
* check events from last 2 weeks - have any of the organizers written something about their events? Any new photo albums, etc.?
* has anyone mentioned Django Girls in any article? Maybe we can add that to the newsletter, too!
* if we are planning or in the process of some important things (like hiring, working on some bigger project, starting some campaign) - make sure to mention it. 
* check [GitHub](https://github.com/DjangoGirls/tutorial) - any big changes in last fortnight? Any new translations finished?
* add upcoming events.
