# Django Girls Wiki 

This is our internal wiki containing the documentation on what it takes to run the show. This is not a document aimed at organizers, coaches or attendees of Django Girls, but at the Django Girls support team -- people who support organizers in making their events happen.

Although if you're an organizer, coach or attendee and you want to know how we work, read along!
